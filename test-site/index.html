    <p>A Bigger Splash is one of a number of paintings Hockney made of
      Californian swimming pools. He has captured the moment just after someone
      has dived in. The splash is the only clue to their presence in the scene.
      Hockney was interested in using paint to capture transparent materials
      such as water, and fleeting moments, like the splash. The 1960s are often
      seen as the time that Britain emerged from the difficulties of the
      post-war years into a period of optimism. This colourful work seems to
      reflect this feeling.</p>

      <li>A Bigger Splash was painted between April and June 1967 when Hockney was
        teaching at the University of California at Berkeley.
      </li>   <!-- #### list item #### -->
      <li>The image is derived in part from a photograph Hockney discovered in
        a book on the subject of building swimming pools.
      </li>
      <li>The background is taken from a drawing he had made of Californian
        buildings.

    <p> A Bigger Splash is the largest and most striking of three ‘splash’
      paintings. The Splash (private collection) and A Little Splash
      (private collection) were both completed in 1966. They share compositional
      characteristics with the later version. All represent a view over a
      swimming pool towards a section of low-slung, 1960s modernist architecture
      in the background.
    </p>    <!-- #### paragraph #### -->

    <p> The painting took about two weeks to complete, providing an interesting
    contrast with his subject matter for the artist. Hockney has explained:
    ‘When you photograph a splash, you’re freezing a moment and it becomes something
    else. I realise that a splash could never be seen this way in real life, it
    happens too quickly. And I was amused by this, so I painted it in a very, very
    slow way.’(Quoted in Kinley, [p.5].) He had rejected the possibility of recreating
    the splash with an instantaneous gesture in liquid on the canvas. In
    contrast with several of his earlier swimming pool paintings, which
    contain a male subject, often naked and viewed from behind, the ‘splash’
    paintings are empty of human presence. However, the splash beneath the
    diving board implies the presence of a diver.
